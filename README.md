Based on the original LaTeX resume template by Jake Gutierrez and inspired by the styling by [Sohan Sethi](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7305585422166892544/), I have made my own personal tweaks that improved the overall formatting. 

There is no need to buy any fancy "ATS friendly resume builder" when you can easily write your own resume for free. Do not fall into their traps when they claim your ATS score is less than 80% (they just want your money). LaTex is known as a document preparation system and widely used by professionals who write research papers and even math homework for any school's cirriculums. You might even find the styles and formatting very similar to your math homework that you have done in the past. Any ATS system can easily read through LaTeX documents, just go ahead and check out what [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates) has to offer!
